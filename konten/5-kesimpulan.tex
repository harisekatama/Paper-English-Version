Based on the test results conducted throughout the execution of this final project, the following are the findings:

\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]

  \item The lowest average delay time was found in the test where JSON with 1 value was sent and transmitted via WiFi. The average delay time was 1.032374783 seconds.
  
  \item The highest average delay time was found in the test where JSON with 2 values was sent and transmitted via Bluetooth. The average delay time was 1.038895345 seconds.
  
  \item The wheelchair tends to deviate to the left when moved with forward control, with an average deviation angle of 2.788\textdegree.
  
  \item The wheelchair tends to deviate to the right when moved with reverse control, with an average deviation angle of 5.494\textdegree.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Recommendation}
\label{chap:saran}

Based on the results obtained from this research, the suggestions that can be considered for further development are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]

  \item The motor rotation speed is controlled through ESP32 using buttons or potentiometers.
  
  \item Trying other data transmission techniques that are more effective and efficient.

\end{enumerate}
